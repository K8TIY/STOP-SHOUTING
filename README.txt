This is a small OS X program that lets you know when your caps lock key is
engaged, so you do not end up SHOUTING INSTEAD OF TYPING. It does this by
putting up a transparent window with a cool-looking caps lock arrow symbol
thingy. 

I rewrote it recently to require Mac OS 10.4 or later, so I could have fun
using a Quartz event tap instead of a timer to detect a change in keyboard
status. This thing now uses insignificant system resources. 

I use the System Prefs "Accounts" pane to add the program as a Login Item to
my account. So, yes, I use this program on a daily basis at work and at home.
